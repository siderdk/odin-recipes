        <li>
            <ol>The rice:
                <li>Properly rinse the rice <b>multiple times</b></li>
                <li>After rinsing your rice multiple times, put in the pot and with the water and let it sink, and add your anis flower</li>
                <li>when your sauce will be simmering, turn the heat on the rice pot, all the way up, until it starts boiling, then turn it to low heat</li>
                <li>when you notice that there is no liquid anymore, set it aside and let it rest</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ol>The sauce: 
            <li>Pre-heat a nice pan, that you drizzeled with enough olive oil</li>
            <li>Roughly cutting the onions and putting them on the pan. The shape won't matter because we will blend everyting later</li>
            <li>Add in the garlic and the ginger pastes</li>
            <li>In the same fashion add the tomatoes and tomatoe paste</li>
            <li>Let everything sear nicely until golden brown</li>
            <li>Now you can add the sugar, remember to add salt to taste</li>
            <li>At this stage, you can throw in all the spices <b>except the mint</b>, which we will keep for the presentation</li>
            <li>Let everything fry on a medium-high heat, then add the vinegar, after which you should add the water and let it simmer nicely for about 40mn</li>
            <li>While everything is simmering you should remember start your rice, and to move to preparing the cream, you can come back here afterwards</li>
            <li>At this stage, your rice is ready, and so is the cream. After everything is nice and mushy, turn off the heat, and remove the bayleaves</li>
            <li>Transfer everything to a big bowl that can stand very warm liquides</li>
            <li>Use your hand mixer or blender to turn everything into a nice and smooth liquid</li>
            <li>With the help of a sieve, pour the filtered and smoother liquid back in the pan, and add the butter</li>
            <li>You can also add the bayleaves back, and make sure your thick sauce is nicely mixed with the butter</li>
            <li>now you can add your cream and crush the dried mint in your palm over the pan</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ol>The cream:
            <li>In a blender add: your heavy cream and cashews. Some people like to leave their cashew in water so they are softer, not me!</li>
            <li>Process everything until very smooth</li>
            <li>Drizzle in your sauce pot at the end</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
